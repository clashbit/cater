 # Cater example: "Emotion"

 ## Instructions

 Example that uses the [Emotion CSS-in-JS](https://github.com/emotion-js/emotion) library.

 Take note of the jest.config.js file for this example. It switches the environment to "node" instead of the default of jsdom. If not included, Emotion assumes it's running in a browser environment.
