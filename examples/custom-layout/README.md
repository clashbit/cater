 # Cater example: "Custom Layout"

 Custom Layout lets you configure the server-side HTML that wrappers your App. You could put Layout.js in either the app or server directories. However, we prefer server as it makes it very clear this component is server-side only.

 ## Instructions

 Assuming you're using the yarn package manager:

    yarn install
    yarn run dev
    # Open your browser to http://localhost:3000
