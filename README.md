Cater is a convention-driven Framework for React and Friends.

At the top level, Cater provides:

- Babel 6
- React 16
- Webpack 3

This library was somewhat inspired from using the [Next.js](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/) Framework. This is an attempt to learn from the ground up, plus take a modular (but convention-driven) approach.

Very much v0.1.1. But feel free to have a poke around. If you want to get an idea, take a look at the "hello-world" package under examples.

Good luck. To get in touch, drop me a line at the author details listed in package.json.
