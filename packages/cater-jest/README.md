# Cater-Jest

Cater-Jest contains utilities for testing with the [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/) framework.

These files are mostly workarounds to enable App-like testing within Jest. For example, the [Cater Workspace Package](https://github.com/jonathannen/cater/blob/master/package.json) will test all of the Cater Packages, plus all the Examples.
